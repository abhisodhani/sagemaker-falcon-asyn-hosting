    "To perform inference on these models, you need to pass custom_attributes='accept_eula=true' as part of header. This means you have read and accept the end-user-license-agreement (EULA) of the model. EULA can be found in model card description or from https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/. By default, this notebook sets custom_attributes='accept_eula=false', so all inference requests will fail until you explicitly change this custom attribute.\n",

If the user passes the same key more than once, the last value is kept and passed to the script handler (i.e., in this case, used for conditional logic). For example, if 'accept_eula=false; accept_eula=true' is passed to the server, then 'accept_eula=true' is kept and passed to the script handler.\n",

Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",

    "- If `max_new_tokens` is not defined, the model may generate up to the maximum total tokens allowed, which is 4K for these models. This may result in endpoint query timeout errors, so it is recommended to set `max_new_tokens` when possible. For 7B, 13B, and 70B models, we recommend to set `max_new_tokens` no greater than 1500, 1000, and 500 respectively, while keeping the total number of tokens less than 4K.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 2 egg yolks\n",
      "* 1/2 cup (120 ml) neutral-tasting oil, such as canola or grapeseed\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) vinegar or lemon juice\n",
      "* 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) salt\n",
      "* 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 ml) cayenne pepper (optional, for some heat)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and salt until well combined.\n",
      "2. Slowly pour the oil into the egg yolk mixture while continuously whisking. It's important to add the oil very slowly, as this will help the mayonnaise emulsify properly.\n",
      "3. Once you've added all the oil, continue whisking for another 30 seconds or so, until the mixture is smooth and creamy.\n",
      "4. Add the vinegar or lemon juice and cayenne pepper (if using), and whisk until well combined.\n",
      "5. Taste the mayonnaise and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may want to add more salt, pepper, or vinegar to suit your taste.\n",
      "6. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the mayonnaise for at least 30 minutes before using. This will allow the flavors to meld together and the mayonnaise to thicken.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's it! This recipe makes about 1 cup (240 ml) of mayonnaise, which you can use in a variety of dishes, such as sandwiches, salads, and dips. Enjoy!\n",
